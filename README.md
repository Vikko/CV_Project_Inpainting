# View point reconstruction using a single image
This project contains different approaches on inpainting to find a suitable method of reconstructing missing data that occurs from viewing from another viewpoint.
Its starts of with a few simple algorithms that reconstruct a right view based on a single image and depth map, then tries to improve the result using simple inpaint techniques and later on more complex methods.
