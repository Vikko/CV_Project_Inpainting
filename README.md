# View point reconstruction using a single image
and depthmap
This project contains different approaches on inpainting to find a suitable method of reconstructing missing data that occurs from viewing from another viewpoint.
Its starts of with a few simple algorithms and works up to the more complex (and computationally heavy) approaches.
